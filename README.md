## Overview

### The challenge

1. Jinja2 template error

  I encounterd a template error (jinja2.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: unexpected '}') and was not able to figure out where the mistake was. So, I copied the template, then pasted one line of code at a time and run the program, it worked out. However, the code are the same.

### What I learned

1. `{{form.name(type='hidden')}}` renders the `name` field as a hidden input. By passing `type='hidden'` as an argumennt to the field rendering method, specify that the field should be rendered with a `type` attribute of `hidden`.
